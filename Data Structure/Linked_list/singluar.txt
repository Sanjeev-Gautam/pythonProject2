explain this def __init__(self, data=None):


__init__ is a special method in Python classes, also known as a constructor.
 It is automatically called when an object of the class is created,
 and it is used to initialize the attributes of the class.

In this specific example, __init__ method is defined in the Node class and it takes one argument: data.
The data parameter is set to None by default, which means that if no data is provided when an object is created,
it will default to None.

The __init__ method initializes the data attribute of the Node object with the provided data,
 and the next attribute with None. This method is called when a new object of the Node class is created,
 and it sets the initial state of the object.
